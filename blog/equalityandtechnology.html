        <p>When I was a kid, I thought that technological innovation had no downfalls.  I mean, according to keynesian supply and demand, innovation both increases the quantity supplied and reduces price.  Practically, technology makes life easier.  This generation is so much wealthier in <i>time</i> than any other previous generation.  I can do my laundry, wash dishes, and go out to eat at the same time, thanks to washing machines and dishwashers.  Without those machines, this all would have taken half a day at least.</p>

        <p>But I can't ignore the historical pattern of technology spurring inequality.  Technological innovation is one of the main ways that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.  The other ways that come to mind are corruption and war.</p>

        <p>It's no secret that the U.S. "wealth gap" is soaring.  MIT Technology Review reports that the richest 1% of the population hold a staggering 34% of the wealth, with the 0.1% holding 15% of the nation's wealth.  It seems that the computer age has done this - appropriating lots of wealth to only a few people.  Part of it is definitely the nature of the software industry and the Internet - it takes only a small team to create a huge amount of wealth.  Facebook, Google, Amazon, they all started as small companies and grew really fast into bigger ones.  There is thus a much more concentrated amount of wealth going to a smaller number of people.</p>

        <p>This whole technology-spurs-inequality idea is really old, however.  The Industrial Revolution around the 1760s, where technology growth was starting to accelerate, produced unimaginably wealthy people like Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller, leaving the rest to work in factories.</p>

        <p>Maybe this age is different too, with the increasing ability to automate things.  Machines are much more precise, software is more advanced, and so jobs that have clear cut rules can be handed to machines.  There's no disadvantage to the company, only the individual.  Unions help, but when you can replace one, you can start replacing them all.  This essentially puts a hard stop on pay to productivity ratio.</p>

        <p>Pessimist and optimist would claim different reasons as to why, but technologist philantropy is definitely on the rise, with a 33% overall increase last year<sup>[1]</sup>.  The surge of tech entrepreneurs also tend to give a lot of money back to the community, such as Bill Gates' renowned contributions and younger entrepreneurs like Jan Koum (WhatsApp) donating about 556 million dollars (to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation).</p>

        <p>I'm still all for innovation.  There's something innately appealing about the brilliant entrepreneur who uses her or his creativity to create something that nobody ever knew that they wanted so badly.  But I'm wondering where all of this will take us, and whether we will regret not taking a different path.  What that path is, I'm not so sure.
