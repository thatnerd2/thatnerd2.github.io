        <p>There are some really bad lessons that are taught in high school.  One of them is the concept of “the trick.” </p>

        <p>This idea has its roots in a couple of education-specific characteristics.  First is that the work that teachers give students is not actually real (otherwise this would be referred to as a “job”), and so usually there isn’t a really compelling reason to do the work other than that it’s excellent practice for building the foundation required for the actual, cool work, but nobody really likes that fact.</p>

        <p>The second stems from the first - the work the teachers give the students often has some preconceived notion of “the right answer.”  Not only is this flat-out misrepresentation of any career, but it’s terribly stifling.  It took me a long time to realize that mathematics isn’t about being handed questions - it’s about asking those questions and then solving them after.  It’s the asking that shows who’s brilliant.  Standardized testing is not helping here.  As far as I understand, the implementation is founded on the idea that we teach the “process” to the students, removing the “magic” (negative connotation here).  The issue is that we’re forcing the process down the student’s throat.  It’s visual, sure, and logical, yes, but intuitive?  Not for everyone.  In my opinion the only way to actually get a student to develop that intuition is to have the student derive the process.  That is a far more useful ability than being able to accept a given process - a subtle but important difference.</p>

        <p>So these and many other factors have contributed to the implicit hunt for “the trick.”  If school is a game, then the trick is an exploit.  Let’s define our terms here first.  Imagine a vegetable you hate, and there’s a bright shiny coin attached to it.  The rule is, you have to eat the vegetable, then you get the coin.  Eating the vegetable is actually really good for your health and development, but you hate it.  The trick would be to figure out how to get to the coin while eating as little of the vegetable as possible.  It would be like using a glitch in a game to get past a hard level without developing the skill needed for the next, even harder level.</p>

        <p>This is like having a math test coming up, and instead of diligently studying the material, you look at each topic to see what would make a “good test question,” and you study that instead.  Perhaps you guess right and ace the test without having to know all of the material, and for that you receive a nice grade.  Websites like Sparknotes and Cliffnotes have gained a lot of popularity by ostensibly offering “the trick.”</p>

        <p>Let’s not forget to mention the opposite situation - a student works fairly diligently on all the subject material but the test happens to take him by surprise.  He receives a bad grade, and it slips all too easily into his ego.  “No matter what I do, I never do well.  I must be a bad student.  Studying doesn’t work for me.”  Little does he know that if he were to buckle down hard, he could ace the tests and walk away with incredible knowledge to boot.  We tend to surrender to our damaged pride, underestimate our abilities, and sell ourselves short.  We are much more capable than we realize.  But high school doesn’t teach us that.</p>

        <p>So what do we get when these kids enter the “real world?”  They will continue to search for tricks.  Sometimes it works, (often in giant, frosty-cold mega corporations that have reward ladders), and sometimes it doesn’t (resolving relationship problems, starting a business).  Some of them will snap out of it when they realize that working through the vegetable builds real competence.  But others will continue to believe in their false intellectual tools and never will learn how to derive the process, how to build new tools to work through problems.  The idea of the genius who can read, analyze and evaluate difficult material in one pass is a complete myth.  Truly brilliant people - Bill Gates, Nikola Tesla, William Shakespeare to name a few - know that behind the dazzling art or innovative invention lies a thousand failures. </p>
