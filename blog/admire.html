        <p>Here's a list of traits that draw me to those who have them, in no particular order.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't apologize trivially.  Apologizing for everything you say gives you a low signal to noise ratio.  Apologizing for things you think important makes you a good person.</li>
          <li>Have a spine.  Backing down from your opinions on a whim means that you haven't thought yourself through.  Similarly, updating your beliefs with new evidence means that you can think through new ideas.</li>
          <li>Be clever, and don't think yourself so.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/randomness.html">See randomness.</a></li>
          <li>Believe in yourself, but don't talk about it.  Constantly talking about your belief in yourself makes you unsufferable.</li>
          <li><b>Ask for what you want.</b></li>
          <li>As Sam Altman said, choose to work hard.  "A surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard."  But not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by.
          <li>Don't laugh if you don't think it funny.  Be true to your sense of humor.  We all have unique ones.</li>
          <li>If you won't do something sincerely, don't do it.  Sometimes it will seem half and half.  In those cases, give sincerity the benefit of the doubt, and try to cultivate it.</li>
          <li>Say what you think.  People have died for freedom of speech.</li>
          <li>Notice good design and compliment it.  Good design is always harder than it seems, much like good writing is simply an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous.</li>
          <li>Don't let fear make you back down from anything.  Consequences are tangible, fear is not.</li>
        </ul>
