        <p>I used to think that being good at art was a trait, like being tall.  This was before I had really talked to a lot of artists about how they were good at art.  I got the simplest answer back - it was because they liked it.</p>

        <p>That was a code-word for they drew/painted/sculpted/did art a lot.  I mean like hours every day.  And what separated the great artists from the good artists was that the great artists spent twice as much truly focused time on art.  I still think that what separates the famous great artists from great artists is equal parts fantastic luck and knowing the right people.</p>

        <p>The idea of the genius who can parse even the most complex material in one go, is a myth.  Well, there are probably a couple, but with that kind of extreme innate ability comes an extreme innate cost.  Hard work, which produces the same kind of result but for a different reason, costs precious time, and for more extreme things, possibly physical/mental health.</p>

        <p>My current impression of all this is that it comes down to a kind of inner toolbox.  Those who make it seem effortless have the right tool for the job.  After all, if you try to tighten a nut with a hammer, it’s not going to work.  Few are born with all the tools, although they can definitely be born with a good feel for some of them (read: talent).  Some people have a lot of tools but aren’t proficient in many of them.  Some people only have a couple of tools but are really really proficient in them.  I would suppose that the former describes the curious person who knows a lot but doesn’t actually try it out.  The latter is the kid who aced all the tests in high school and claimed they were easy, and then gets crushed like a soda can in college when his tools stop working and he doesn’t know how to build new ones.</p>

        <p>I’ve yet to find some subject in which talent wins over hard work.</p>
