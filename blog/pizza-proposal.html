      	<h2>The Pitch</h2>
        <p>Dining Dollars and Cougar Cash cover most every food on campus, from tacos to sandwiches to groceries.  How do you order pizza with your meal plan?  You can't.  Ordering pizza is a big leak in the seal.</p>

        <p>I propose a no-frills, easy-access way to patch the leak.  Suppose there was a website, verified and secured by BYU, where students could exchange Dining dollars or Cougar Cash for an order of pizza.  Behind the scenes, cash would be given to the pizza companies, and dining dollars would be accumulated, then fed back into BYU financial services for a reimbursement.  The strength of the Dining Dollars and Cougar Cash currencies would gain a strong pillar of support, and students would be happy.  It's a win-win.  I believe I have the time and ability to make it happen. </p>

        <p>Do students want this?  I surveyed various floors of Heritage Halls to find out, and the answer is a resounding yes.  On average, about 2 pizzas were ordered per dorm.  About 85% of those surveyed preferred paying with Cougar Cash or Dining Dollars rather than American money.  Students agreed that it would be more simple, and convenient.</p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>I think the idea is plausible, and phrased the right way, benevolent.  I intend it to be both.  But there are problems with it.  Can you see them?</p>

        <p>I'm planning on proposing this idea to the Financial Services office this coming Tuesday (January 26th, 2016).  I will be speaking to the Assistant Treasurer of the Financial Services Office, John Leatherwood.  Even his name sounds hard-boiled.  He probably can't take a yolk.</p>

        <p>To those wondering, I've already pitched to BYU Student Association, and YServe.  Since this isn't a club (I thought that maybe it could slide under the radar as one, using a club website, club funds, and club fundraising tactics), BYUSA turned me away.  I think that's fair.  YServe offered me an official proposal application, but I neglected to mention that it was for profit, since those two words together would mean instant death to the idea.  YServe is about community service, after all.  In sum, both considered it a good idea, and refused out of context rather than skepticism.  That's an okay sign.</p>

        <p>I would have preferred either to duking it out with Financials.  Emotional arguments mean something to student associations.  Cold logic, incentive-tracing, and fifty years of calcified tradition rule in the Financial Services department.  These experienced people are much better at detecting bull than I am at producing it.  Plus, they have the birds-eye view of the field.  They know BYU's finances like a piano player knows the keys.</p>

        <h2>Proposal's Flaws</h2>
        <p>The killer counterargument is "We do our best to keep Dining Dollars on-campus only."  There are implications here.</p>

        <p>If I can serve as man in the middle between cash and Dining Dollars, what's preventing me from taking Dining Dollars and shipping stuff from Amazon?  <b>Answer:</b>  Probably a legal contract.</p>

       	<p>Harder still, it seems that BYU enjoys keeping an internal currency to be just that: internal.  The flow of money is always within BYU.  This is what helps them escape taxes and credit card fees.  Extending the reach of the currency addles its purpose.  This is the main issue I'm struggling with resolving.  It's a design flaw down to the foundation of the pizza proposal, don't you think?</p>

       	<p>So I'm asking for your volunteer brainstorming.  Is there a way out of that counterargument?  Yes or no, I'm still going to pitch.</p>
