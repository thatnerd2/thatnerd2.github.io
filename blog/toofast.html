        <p>That saying “High school is a game” is not without reason.  Those who play the game hunt for the “right” answers and the “right” methods, and those who see the game for what it is and don’t want to be a part of it, opt out.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking lately about the hardcore players of this particular game.  They move too fast.  Sometimes it’s actually physical - I can see them hurrying from class to class and sports game to music lesson.  I wish we could slow down and think about ourselves and who we are for a while, instead of just what we do.  But if one teenager had to slow down, then every teenager would have to slow down.  Why is that?</p>

        <p>Among the hardcore players, high school is currently an arms race.  It’s not five or six extracurriculars, it’s ten or twelve.  And you have to have won a national science or mathematics competition too.  You can see this in the kind of insane leverage that the elite universities hold.  If Harvard required every student to send a picture of themselves punching their face to show "willpower" or something, students would do it, and they would do it really well.</p>

        <p>These “high-achievement” kids are as much determined by their success metrics as the popular kids are by the clothes they wear and other popular kids they hang around.  And I don’t know of any other person or entity that works so hard at something as some secondary school kids work at being popular.  This becomes an issue when high achievers or popular kids identify as “high achievers” or “popular kids” rather than “kid who really likes programming computers” and “kid who enjoys this style of fashion.”  Do you see the difference?  The enjoyment of the activity is irrelevant in the former.</p>

        <p>The second, pernicious driver of this arms race is envy.  Competition has a strange way of forcing envy upon its participants.  It’s disconcerting to those who are not naturally envious people, to have this feeling of envy imposed upon them.  High achievers have learned to draw some kind of murky strength from envy, but at the cost of direction - envy naturally pulls you in the direction of what you’re envious of, and most likely it’s not what you really want.</p>

        <p>So a question that each one of these high achievers is going to face eventually, is “is this what I want?”  Obviously not every one of them is going to respond yes, because most of them go into medicine or investment banking or engineering, and none of them go into philosophy or history, and I can guarantee you that there are a lot of very smart people who love the latter but feel forced into the former.  And another question is “why do I want this?”  Unfortunate answers to both leads to what’s known as “burnout” in college, which is essentially the realization of the game, and the opting out all at once.</p>

        <p>Yes, you have to pay the bills.  But you don’t have to be in the Forbes 30 under 30.  Wouldn’t it be amazing if it was societally okay to be poor, and happy?  If only we could attach our happiness to our identities in place of our salaries and job titles.</p>

        <p>So slow down high schoolers!  Make sure you want your path as much as your actions say you do.</p>
