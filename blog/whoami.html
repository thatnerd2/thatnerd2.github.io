        <p>This is an honest self-evaluation, for better or for worse.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Sometimes I envy the kids who started out loving the piano.  I certainly didn't.  Through my kid-eyes, life was either play, where I got to do what I wanted, or work, where adults told me what to do.  Practicing the piano was firmly on the side of work.  I tried to get away with as little practicing as possible. (5/6/7 yrs)</p>

        <p>The only way my parents/teacher/myself could get me to practice was to entice me with video game music.  It turns out that video game music is fairly difficult to play, so I ended up developing technique, 95% thanks to my brilliant piano teacher.  Mostly vividly, I played the fight themes from Final Fantasy 4 and 6 (8 yrs old), and the Mario brothers classic theme song (10 yrs old).  That one was pretty tough.</p>

        <p>At a certain point in any skill, you start being able to do whatever you want.  Good cooks, with the right ingredients, can make what they want.  Programmers can build what they want.  And when you have sufficient technical skill and the sheet music, you can play whatever you want on the piano.  Due to some combination of developing musical taste, and unlocking a new difficulty tier of classical music, I found out that some classical pieces sounded good.  I started to drift back toward the classical, playing Gershwin's preludes (~12 years), Maple Leaf Rag, etc.</p>

        <p>Around 14, I started to compete.  I entered the Parillo piano competition, with Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu and a Beethoven Concerto.  I lost (to someone playing a fancy Granados piece).  And then something lit up in the ambitious part of my brain.  This story probably doesn't have a good moral, but previous to the competition, I had been playing for my parents, for my teacher, and maybe 5% for myself.  Now I was playing to win.  I started practicing more, averaging about 1 hour a day.  I entered the Chopin Piano competition with the Fantasie Impromptu, and forgot how the middle section went, midway through the performance.  I think I cried out of annoyance at myself that time.  I kicked up the practicing to 2 hours a day.</p>

        <p>At 15, I entered the Parillo again, now with Rachmaninoff's Etude op. 39 no. 1.  Go on youtube and listen to that piece.  It's a monster, and I could play it (at least, to 97% clarity).  I lost again, but I had to admit that I could play a serious beast of a piece.  In retrospect, while technically impressive, it was a terrible competition piece.</p>

        <p>At 16, I entered the Parillo again but it was cancelled (I think I was practicing a Mozart concerto), so I went for the Chopin Competition, Masters level.  I was going to have to compete against 21 year olds from Saint Rose College, so I needed some big guns.  I prepared Chopin's 4th Ballade, a notoriously difficult piece both musically and technically, and paired it with Chopin's Revolutionary Etude, the famous one with the nasty left hand part.  I didn't pick them just because they were hard - I loved those pieces.  I practiced them to death.  I played them well, I won the Chopin competition.  $1000 and (local) fame were mine.</p>

        <p>I got 2nd in the following Albany Tchaikovsky competition, playing Rachmaninoff's Etude op 39 no. 6, "Little Red Riding Hood." That's plausibly the hardest piece technically I've ever played.  No musicality in it though, and the judge was the teacher of the student who won, so I wasn't surprised.  I entered the Parillo competition again, playing a Macdowell Concerto.  Me and the MacDowell didn't really get along well, and I lost.  It didn't help that one of my opponents was Rachel Sohn, an infamously good, young competitive pianist.</p>

        <p>I competed a lot, so my pieces were usually selected with competitions in mind, but know that I was always the one submitting the piece, not my teacher.  They fit the bill because I said they did.</p>

        <p>At 17, I practiced Edvard Grieg's piano concerto, first movement, over the summer.  I entered the Ithaca Concerto Competition with the Grieg, and bombed it.  The acoustics weren't right, I had only practiced with my accompanist (who seemed kind of off, to be honest) an hour before, and I was terribly nervous.  Rachel Sohn was also competing, and I think she won that one.  I played Lyapunov's Transcendental Etude no. 6, "The Storm" for the Tchaikovsky competition, and took first.  That piece was right up my alley.  I then took that same piece to the Parillo, along with the Grieg I had practiced over the summer (I planned the Grieg so it could be used for two competitions).  I played terribly at the competition, and thought I lost my last chance at the silly plaque.  It turns out I played better than I thought, and was awarded co-1st place!  That's how I conquered the three biggest competitions in my area.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, my schedule doesn't allow time for piano lessons.  I'm still working on a piece I've wanted to work on forever, Rachmaninoff's famous 2nd Concerto, movement 1.  It's a beast, and I'm loving every note of it.  Sometimes I play it in public for kicks.  Someday I want to master jazz improvisation.</p>
