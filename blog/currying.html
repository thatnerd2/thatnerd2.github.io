        <p>Suppose we have some \(f(a, b)\) where a and b are strings, and the function prints a + ": " + b.  So, \(f\)("hello", "world"), the console would show "hello: world".  Pretty simple.  Suppose, for some reason, I want to derive a function \(g(b)\) that does the same thing as \(f\), but always says "hello: ", and then whatever you pass in as b.  Basically, I'd like to hold the "a" argument constant for this new function g.</p>

        <p>One obvious way to do this is to make a whole new function that repeats code from \(f\), just making the "a" parameter constant.  It turns out that some functions take a lot of code, so duplicating the function would get messy. If your programming language supports passing functions around as arguments, you can do what's called "currying" a function, which allows us to pass in arguments we want held constant, and get back a <b>function</b>.  Specifically, this is what would be called "currying a dyadic function" because \(f\) takes two arguments.</p>

        <p>Here's how currying a dyadic function would look:</p>

        <pre>
function f(a, b) {
    print a + ": " + b
}

function curry_f (a) {
    return function (b) {
        f(a, b);
    }
}
        </pre>

        <p>Notice that I didn't <b>call</b> f when I call curry_f.  The function curry_f <b>returns another function that holds the argument given to it constant.</b>  So, if I called 'curry_f("hello")' then I would get back a <b>function</b> that's like f but always says "hello" first.  Cool, right?</p>

        <p>Using curry_f to produce g:</p>

        <pre>
f("hello", "world") # would print "hello: world"
g = curry_f("hello") # now g is the function we want
g("goodbye") # would print "hello: goodbye"
        </pre>
        <br>
        <h3>Currying Versus Partial Function Application</h3>
        <p>The differences between currying and partial function application are subtle because they do similar things.  From what I understand, currying <b>breaks the original function into all of its pieces by argument</b>, so you'd get a bunch of <i>unary</i> functions, whereas partial function application can leave functions with two or more arguments left.  You could partially apply a three argument function to hold one argument constant and end up with a dyadic function, but if you say "I'm going to curry that three argument function" you imply that you're going to split it into 3 unary functions.</p>
