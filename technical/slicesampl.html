        <i>Read the writeup on rejection sampling first.</i>
        <p>Slice sampling is a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, like the Metropolis Hastings.  To see why this works (ergodic theorem), read the Metropolis Hastings writeup.</p>

        <p>In rejection sampling, there's a probability of rejection.  In slice sampling, there isn't.  It's simply because of the algorithm that slice sampling employs:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose a random starting value of x, let's call it x1</li>
          <li>Uniformly sample on interval [0, f(x1)], let's call it a</li>
          <li>Here's the tricky part - imagine a horizontal line at y = a.  Figure out all the line segments under the curve.</li>
          <li>From all the line segments, draw a value of x uniformly.</li>
          <li>Repeat from step 2 until you have as many draws as you want.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier to implement than Metropolis Hastings</li>
          <li>Faster than Rejection sampling</li>
          <li>The step-size feature of MH is tough to get right, and is constant.  Slice-sampling auto-adjusts the step size for you.</li>
          <li>In the cases of slow sampling because of the shape of the distribution (the bigger the x interval, the slower it is to find the roots of the intersections), you can fit slice sampling with an ellipcal curve for say, Guassian priors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Probably slower than Metropolis Hastings.</li>
          <li>Finding the roots of the intersection between horizontal line and distribution is pretty tricky.  See the implementation below for a very naive example.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>Here's a code sample in R.  This implements slice sampling of a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2.  I used an x interval of 0 to 20, with 0.1 root finding step size.</p>

        <p>The way I find the roots is very naive.  I step through the interval, looking for sign differences - if I find one, I use R uniroot to locate the root.  I then iterate through each root and take the midpoint, checking if it's under the curve to detect a valid line segment.  Then, I distribute probabilities to the line segments, sampling one segment.  Then, I uniformly select an x from the sampled line segment.</p>

    pts[i] = x

        # Signs don't match, so we have a root.
        root = uniroot(fshift, c(j, j + root.accuracy))$root

      if (f(midpoint) > y) {
        # Since this line segment is under the curve, add it to segments.
        segments = rbind(segments, c(roots[j], roots[j + 1]))
      }
    }
    
    # Uniformly sample next x from segments
    # Assign each segment a probability, then unif based on those probabilities.
    # This is a bit of a hack because segments first row is NA, NA
    # Yet, subsetting it runs the risk of reducing the matrix to a vector in special case.

      segments[i, 2] - segments[i, 1]

      (segments[i, 2] - segments[i, 1]) / total
    })
