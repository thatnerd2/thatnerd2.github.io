        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <p>I wasn't a good student in elementary school, especially in mathematics.  I could handle history and writing, although I'm convinced the teachers go extra easy on students for those subjects.  It's hard to have leeway in an addition problem.  I remember mostly that I couldn't multiply.  I understood the process, I always got an answer, and it was always wrong.  People told me "You should be more careful", but what they really should have said was "You should practice multiplying more."  I never practiced.</p>

        <p>I got sent to remedial math camp between elementary and middle school, the 5th and 6th grades.  They tried to teach me math using candy, but I was mostly interested in the latter.  I could handle middle school math proportional to how much I convinced myself to practice.  There were definitely ups and downs.</p>

        <p>In high school I kicked into high gear academically, but not for the right reasons.  50% was wanting to "win" and "beat the game", and 50% was to not disappoint my parents.  Neither of the reasons were for learning.  I probably would have gotten more out of high school if I had pushed for learning.</p>

        <p>That being said, I studied hard in high school.  I got all "A"s and "A+"s, and applied to MIT, CMU, Stanford and BYU.  I got rejected from MIT, CMU and Stanford, and accepted to BYU as a Monson Scholar.  So, the college choice was pretty clear.  I was admitedly upset about not being accepted into the highest tier schools, but I wasn't really surprised.  I wasn't as surprised about that as my friends were.</p>

        <p>So, here I am at BYU.  The academics here, I would say, are slightly easier than high school.  Sometimes it upsets me that I might not be challenged enough here.  But I think the side projects I put on myself and the high credit load somewhat make up for it.  After all, there are amazing programmers who have had no formal education at all.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Sometimes I envy the kids who started out loving the piano.  I certainly didn't.  Through my kid-eyes, life was either play, where I got to do what I wanted, or work, where adults told me what to do.  Practicing the piano was firmly on the side of work.  I tried to get away with as little practicing as possible. (5/6/7 yrs)</p>

        <p>The only way my parents/teacher/myself could get me to practice was to entice me with video game music.  It turns out that video game music is fairly difficult to play, so I ended up developing technique, 95% thanks to my brilliant piano teacher.  Mostly vividly, I played the fight themes from Final Fantasy 4 and 6 (8 yrs old), and the Mario brothers classic theme song (10 yrs old).  That one was pretty tough.</p>

        <p>At a certain point in any skill, you start being able to do whatever you want.  Good cooks, with the right ingredients, can make what they want.  Programmers can build what they want.  And when you have sufficient technical skill and the sheet music, you can play whatever you want on the piano.  Due to some combination of developing musical taste, and unlocking a new difficulty tier of classical music, I found out that some classical pieces sounded good.  I started to drift back toward the classical, playing Gershwin's preludes (~12 years), Maple Leaf Rag, etc.</p>

        <p>Around 14, I started to compete.  I entered the Parillo piano competition, with Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu and a Beethoven Concerto.  I lost (to someone playing a fancy Granados piece).  And then something lit up in the ambitious part of my brain.  This story probably doesn't have a good moral, but previous to the competition, I had been playing for my parents, for my teacher, and maybe 5% for myself.  Now I was playing to win.  I started practicing more, averaging about 1 hour a day.  I entered the Chopin Piano competition with the Fantasie Impromptu, and forgot how the middle section went, midway through the performance.  I think I cried out of annoyance at myself that time.  I kicked up the practicing to 2 hours a day.</p>

        <p>At 15, I entered the Parillo again, now with Rachmaninoff's Etude op. 39 no. 1.  Go on youtube and listen to that piece.  It's a monster, and I could play it (at least, to 97% clarity).  I lost again, but I had to admit that I could play a serious beast of a piece.  In retrospect, while technically impressive, it was a terrible competition piece.</p>

        <p>At 16, I entered the Parillo again but it was cancelled (I think I was practicing a Mozart concerto), so I went for the Chopin Competition, Masters level.  I was going to have to compete against 21 year olds from Saint Rose College, so I needed some big guns.  I prepared Chopin's 4th Ballade, a notoriously difficult piece both musically and technically, and paired it with Chopin's Revolutionary Etude, the famous one with the nasty left hand part.  I didn't pick them just because they were hard - I loved those pieces.  I practiced them to death.  I played them well, I won the Chopin competition.  $1000 and (local) fame were mine.</p>

        <p>Using the same pieces, I submitted a performance tape for the NY Young Musician's Award, and received it.</p>

        <p>I got 2nd in the following Albany Tchaikovsky competition, playing Rachmaninoff's Etude op 39 no. 6, "Little Red Riding Hood." That's plausibly the hardest piece technically I've ever played.  No musicality in it though, and the judge was the teacher of the student who won, so I wasn't surprised.  I entered the Parillo competition again, playing a Macdowell Concerto.  Me and the MacDowell didn't really get along well, and I lost.  It didn't help that one of my opponents was Rachel Sohn, an infamously good, young competitive pianist.</p>

        <p>I competed a lot, so my pieces were usually selected with competitions in mind, but know that I was always the one submitting the piece, not my teacher.  They fit the bill because I said they did.</p>

        <p>At 17, I practiced Edvard Grieg's piano concerto, first movement, over the summer.  I entered the Ithaca Concerto Competition with the Grieg, and bombed it.  The acoustics weren't right, I had only practiced with my accompanist (who seemed kind of off, to be honest) an hour before, and I was terribly nervous.  Rachel Sohn was also competing, and I think she won that one.  I played Lyapunov's Transcendental Etude no. 6, "The Storm" for the Tchaikovsky competition, and took first.  That piece was right up my alley.  I then took that same piece to the Parillo, along with the Grieg I had practiced over the summer (I planned the Grieg so it could be used for two competitions).  I played terribly at the competition, and thought I lost my last chance at the silly plaque.  It turns out I played better than I thought, and was awarded co-1st place!  That's how I conquered the three biggest competitions in my area.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, my schedule doesn't allow time for piano lessons.  I'm still working on a piece I've wanted to work on forever, Rachmaninoff's famous 2nd Concerto, movement 1.  It's a beast, and I'm loving every note of it.  Sometimes I play it in public for kicks.  Someday I want to master jazz improvisation.</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>Programming and I have a long history.  I think I was around eight years old when I decided that I too, wanted to make Flash games.  I used to play on addictinggames.come and the like, and Flash seemed the easiest way to do interactive media that can be put on the web.  For the uninitiated to Flash, Flash has a scripting language attached to it called Actionscript 3, which follows the ECMAScript language specification.  Javascript follows the same spec, so the two languages are very similar.</p>

        <p>One of the coolest things I got to do with Flash was use the Adobe Flash to Android App kit, using Adobe AIR.  I freelanced for a little bit on the android dev forums, asking people if they needed anything built.  One of the sketchiest things I did was build a dice roller that could be intentionally rigged by the person holding the phone, by placing their thumb in a particular spot.</p>

        <p>It turns out that Flash began to die in a few years, and I wanted something that I could run on more computers.  I chose Java around 13 years old - I wanted something fast, the JVM sounded pretty cool, and C++ scared me.  All my algoritm contest practice was in Java, and I think that it strengthened my theory - I started to figure out what object oriented programming was good and bad for, what static typing and strict type checking were, the differences between compile-time and run-time, etc.  Most of these explorations were still basic.  I created a few games in Swing, and spent some time working on an open-source improved Minecraft-like game, called Mosstest, for which I was writing the renderer, using JMonkeyEngine3.  In these days, if I wanted to write something, I'd write it in Java.</p>

        <p>Three teammates and I took first place in the Siena College sponsored high school programming contest writing algorithms in Java, my sophomore year in high school.</p>

        <p>Concurrently with Java, I learned the whole HTML/CSS/Javascript suite, and built a few websites for fun.  One time, I converted a real estate agency's website from Flash to HTML/CSS/Javascript for them.  Another time, I built a website for a farm.</p>

        <p>I was just barely 16 when I took an independent contractor job with General Electric, to work on this huge airline and air traffic simulation.  I picked up the language in which the simulation was written, MATLAB, and found that MATLAB is built on top of Java, and actually has a separate JVM running inside of it.  Thus, when asked to speed up some algorithms within the simulation, I could drop to Java, which sped up the algorithm <b>significantly</b>.  I think the best I did was drop a 297 second algorithm to 2 seconds, although for that particular I added binary search and a bit of dynamic programming, so it wasn't just the language change.</p>

        <p>More importantly, I was put on a project to work on integrating said airline simulation with GE's huge Industrial Internet initiative - the main focus of a new group based in San Ramon, California.  That made me popular, because the software was new, and a large part of it was based on the web languages, using Angular (1.0) for the front-end "visualization" toolkit.  The basic gist is that I was putting the airline simulation on the web.  I definitely got familiar with industrial scale coding.</p>

        <p>In that year of school I wanted to teach other people how to code, so I founded my high school's Computer Science club.  It was mildly successful, but it turns out that learning to code is pretty intimidating, so club activities only (esp. only twice a week) could only supplement, not teach.</p>

        <p>Around 17 years old, I got tired of Java's verbosity and started looking for languages that were faster to program in.  I settled on Python (2), and enjoyed the syntactical features - list comprehensions, immutable tuples, minimalist file reading and writing (no more BufferedWriter on top of PrintWriter on top of FileWriter!), to name a few.  Not to mention the huge number of libraries, that in sum probably rival the JVM in utility.  I suppose that if I needed to build something fast right now, I'd do it in Python.  Depending on what it was though, I might go with R or Haskell.</p>

        <p>At BYU Provo in the fall, I already sensed that freshmen classes weren't going to teach me anything substantial.  I managed to put my foot between the door and frame of a well-known Statistics professor, Dr. Reese, and with some convincing, got a position as Research Assistant for the Statistics department.  That was a good idea.  To this day, I get the most learning out of research, especially because it's in a field I'm so unfamiliar with.  Also, Bayesian statistics focuses heavily on modeling, so I get to do some computational modeling in R.</p>

        <p>In yet another search for a shorter, terser language than even Python, I settled on Haskell.  Haskell's pure FP style is unforgiving, but when used right, makes my mind explode every time.  It's a blast.  I can't quite do everything I want to do in Haskell yet, but I'm working on it.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Good programmers aren't desperate for a job - they can work wherever they want.  So most want to work on something that makes the world better.  I want to cultivate exacting taste, a sense of disatisfaction with the world [1], and the ability to gratify both.  This is how I believe great things are made.</p>

        <p>Does this mean I want to start a company?  No, what I want is upstream from that.  I want to make great things, so if a an existing company offers something I believe in, I will gladly support them.  If I feel the need for something that doesn't yet exist, I'll create it myself.</p>

        <p>[1] This is a surprisingly hard attribute to cultivate, especially for religious people.  Religious people are taught to be content with what God gives, so they silence the nagging voice in their head that says "Hey, this isn't as good as it could be."  Disatisfaction is different from cynicism.  One way to reduce the word disatisfaction is clear-thinking + optimism. Cynicism is concentrated pessimism - pessimism so strong it devours optimism.
